# responsive-resume
This project is a personal resume website created as part of the **Responsive Web Design** assignment.
The site is built using pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and it showcases my skills, education, experience, and interests in a clean and responsive format.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using **media queries** and **relative units** like percentages and `em` values.
- **Custom CSS**: The project uses custom styling with **no frameworks** such as Bootstrap. Colors, fonts, and layouts are defined manually to ensure a unique design.
- **Interactive Elements**: A responsive navigation menu that collapses on smaller screens, along with a "Back to Top" button for better user experience.
- **Clean, Semantic HTML**: The HTML structure uses semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better readability and accessibility.

## Sections

- **Summary**: A brief description of myself and my aspirations.
- **Education**: Details about my educational background.
- **Awards**: Recognition for my achievements, including scholarships and leadership roles.
- **Professional Experience**: Key experiences and skills acquired during my internship and projects.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: A list of my involvement in volunteer work and other activities.
- **Skills & Interests**: Highlights of my technical and personal interests, such as software development, AI, and competitive swimming.
- **Languages**: Proficiency in multiple languages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling the website and ensuring responsiveness.
